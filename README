This is the code to make SDSS/LRG catalogs to reconstruct Halo catalogs by removing satellite galaxies
using Counts-in-Cylinder method devloped by Reid & Spergel 2009.

Although the fraction of satellite galaxies are just about 6% of the LRG catalog,
they are major sources of the non-linear redshift distortions, known as Fingers-of-God (FoG) effect,
which makes the theoretical modeling of the LRG clusterings difficult.
The reconstructed halo catalogs significantly reduces the systematics due to FoG effect and then
improve the accuracy of the growth rate measurement.
